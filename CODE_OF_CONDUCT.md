# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Ada Result Library community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing technical approaches and programming paradigms
* Providing helpful and constructive code reviews
* Sharing knowledge and helping others learn Ada and functional programming concepts

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Dismissive or condescending behavior toward contributors of different skill levels
* Deliberately introducing bugs or security vulnerabilities
* Spamming issues or pull requests with irrelevant content
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Technical Standards

In addition to behavioral standards, we maintain high technical standards:

* **Code Quality**: All contributions should follow Ada best practices and the project's coding standards
* **Documentation**: Code should be well-documented with clear explanations of complex algorithms
* **Testing**: New features and bug fixes should include appropriate tests
* **Performance**: Consider the performance implications of changes, especially in a library focused on efficiency
* **Memory Safety**: Maintain the library's commitment to memory safety and RAII principles

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:

* GitHub repositories and related discussions
* Issue tracking and pull request reviews
* Community forums and chat channels
* Conference presentations and technical talks about the project
* Social media interactions related to the project

## Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

1. **GitHub Issues**: For public technical disputes or minor behavioral issues, you may open an issue
2. **Direct Contact**: For serious violations or sensitive matters, contact the project maintainers directly
3. **Email**: Send detailed reports to the project maintainers (contact information available in the project repository)

### What to Include in Reports

When reporting an incident, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, including any relevant links or screenshots
* Any additional context that may be helpful
* Whether you believe this is an ongoing situation

### Response Process

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Community leaders will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours
2. Review and investigate the incident thoroughly
3. Determine appropriate response measures
4. Communicate the outcome to the reporter
5. Take corrective action as necessary

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. Contacting the project maintainers with a detailed explanation
2. Providing any additional context or evidence
3. Requesting a review of the enforcement action

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the original enforcement decision.

## Building a Positive Community

We encourage all community members to:

* **Be Patient**: Remember that people have different levels of experience with Ada and functional programming
* **Be Helpful**: Share your knowledge and help others learn
* **Be Constructive**: Provide specific, actionable feedback in code reviews
* **Be Respectful**: Value diverse perspectives and approaches to problem-solving
